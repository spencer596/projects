# Project 5: Javascript

* Author: Spencer Pattillo
* Class: CS354 Section #2

## Overview

It basically parses a Json file and fills the store with Users and how many times they show up. 

## Reflection

Well this project was kind of a pain, but not as bad as prolog. There was tons of resources for javascript. I didn't like how javascript scoping worked. It was very strange when I tried using readline for the function.
It didn't store the values while reading the lines which I hated. I had to use some weird JSON reader instead. It took me a while to finally figure that out. Overall, this project isn't as bad as the last one. 

## Compiling and Using
For some reason the sort function is weird on my linux virtual machine but the output pretty much matches the original output so. 
node driver.js <path to JSON data file> <tag to search for> use that command line and you should be good to go. 

## Results

The results pretty much match up what I want. 

## Sources used

Javascript documentation.
